Make Medium Readable Again
==========================

I've gotten a little tired of showing up to a Medium-powered site on a non-medium.com domain and getting badgered to **Sign Up!** or **Get Updates!** when I'm already a Medium user. It's also annoying to have a vertically-small reading viewport because the top and bottom nav bars don't auto-hide. I know -- _Who owns a 12.1" laptop anymore?_, right? Well... today I decided I couldn't abide that anymore, and made a Chrome extension to neutralize these user hostilities.

This is that Chrome extension.

I'm Matt Baer, and I'm tired of annoying, user-hostile software. So I built a publishing space called [Write.as](https://write.as) that doesn't beg you to sign up, [lets you read](https://read.write.as), and leaves out the comments, claps, and [dickbars](https://daringfireball.net/2017/06/medium_dickbars). It's great if you just want to be left alone to get your thoughts out. And if you get lonely, you can always publish straight to Medium.
